\problemname{Uzbek Trek}

Traveler Todd plans on making the trek from Kazakhstan to Turkmenistan.
In order to do so, he must navigate through the great nation of Uzbekistan.

\medskip

Unfortunately, Uzbekistan imposes a tax on all foreign travelers who pass
through it. Uzbekistan has imposed a particularly peculiar tax on Todd.
While trekking through Uzbekistan, Todd must wear special shoes with the
blue, white and green flag of Uzbekistan stiched onto them.

\medskip

However, each shoe only lasts for a certain amount of footsteps. Moreover,
the $k$th type of shoe lasts for exactly $p^k$ footsteps where $k \ge 0$.

\medskip

Todd predetermines that it will take him $n$ footsteps to travel through
Uzbekistan. He then goes to the Uzbek Shoe Depot where he purchases all
the shoes he needs to complete his journey.

\medskip

The Uzbek Shoe Depot is a luxury store. Todd can order as many shoes as he
likes. For each shoe, Todd gets to pick $k$ which determines the type 
of the shoe. Help Todd determine how many ways he can order sets of shoes so
that he can wear all the shoes in sequence to travel \textbf{exactly} $n$
footsteps!

\medskip

Note that two sets of shoes are considered the same if they have the same
number of shoes of each type.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains space-separated integers $n$ and $p$ such that
$1 \leq n \leq 10^9$ and $10^2 \leq p \leq 10^9$.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer, the number of ways to express $n$ as a sum of
powers of $p$. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

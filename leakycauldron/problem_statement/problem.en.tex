\problemname{Leaky Cauldron}

In a faraway magical land, there exists a very large cauldron. Unfortunately, it is leaking today! The cauldron holds a massive amount of water, but is leaking onto a rectangular stone area. The cauldron is floating right above the center square of the stone area, and over time, the water will spread from the center square outward.

The water flows down into the center square of a $N$ by $M$ grid, After $h$ seconds, we know that the water level in the center square (which has the lowest height) is guaranteed to be at height $h$. More specifically, all squares that are height $h$ or below and are connected to the center square will be covered with water. Given this, find the area of the largest rectangle at each point in time up until $H$ seconds.

\section*{Input}
On the first line, there will be 3 integers $N$, $M$, and $H$ respectively, with $1 \le N, M \le 200$ and $1 \le H \le 2500$. Then, the following $N$ lines will each contain $M$ space separated integers, each with a single height $h$, where $1 \le h \le H$. It is guarunteed that $N, M$ are odd.

\section*{Output}
$h + 1$ lines, where the $i^th$ line is the largest rectangle of water when the water height has reached height $i$ in the middle square.

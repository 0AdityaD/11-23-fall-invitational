\problemname{Candy Consumption}

Kevin has $N$ different types of candies and an unlimited supply of each one. He has a unique procedure for
eating these candies, which involves randomly selecting a type, eating a candy of that type, and continuing
until he eats a candy type that he has already eaten previously (at which point he gets bored and stops).
The candies Kevin eats and the order he eats them in form a candy consumption sequence. How many candies will
Kevin eat across all possible candy consumption sequences. Since this answer can be very large, output the
answer mod $1000000007$.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains a single integer $N$ such that $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer representing the number of candy consumed over all possible sequences mod
$1000000007$.

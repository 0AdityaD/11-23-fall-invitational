\problemname{Dominant Conversations}

Whenever people get together, there are some people who dominate regions of the conversation.
We are given a record of a $N$-second long conversation which details who was talking at each second
(people talk in second-long intervals). For each of $K$ people, your job is to find out the number of
regions of the conversation they dominate. A region is a chunk of time from second $i$ to second $j$
inclusive, with $i \leq j$, and it is dominated by person $k$ if more that half of the entries in
the range $[i,j]$ of the record are $k$.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains space-separated integers $n,k$ such that $1 \leq n,k \leq 10^6$.
The second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_i$, the entries in the record. $0 \leq a_i < k$

\section*{Output}
Output $k$ lines, the $i$th of which denotes the number of regions dominated by the $i$th person ($0$-indexed).
